# Christian Gileski's Portfolio

If you are reading this on Github, thank you for taking the time to do so! I encourage you to check out the live site at www.christiangileski.com.

## Tools

While the contents of the website were all created from scratch, this website took a handful of tools to come together.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) was used bootstrap the application and take care of everything under the hood.
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) was used to register the domain and maintain DNS records.
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) was used to deploy the site.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) was used for the styling.
- Mark Kirkpatrick's art was used for the background image. You can find him on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/visualhuman) and [Behance](https://www.behance.net/mkcreativeco).
- [@szhsin/react-menu](https://szhsin.github.io/react-menu/) was used for the mobile burger menu.
